# Japan Microseasons API

This project provides a simple API to access information about the microseasons of Japan, a unique aspect of the traditional Japanese calendar that divides the year into even more detailed segments than the usual four seasons. The data is served from a static JSON file and can be accessed through a RESTful API endpoint.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine. You will need `Node.js` installed to run the server.
